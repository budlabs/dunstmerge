# `dunstmerge` - Dunst layout manager

SYNOPSIS
--------

`dunstmerge` [`-v`|`-h`]  
`dunstmerge` [*LAYOUT*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

`dunstmerge` merges three different files inside *DUNST_DIR*
into one dunstrc file. The files that gets merged are:  

- dunst-theme  
- layouts/LAYOUT  
- dunst-settings  

If *LAYOUT* is omitted `dunstmerge` will look in the
current `dunstrc` file for the name of the current layout
and use that, which will result in a reload of dunst.
If *layouts/LAYOUT* doesn't exist, *default* will be used.  

The advantage of using this is that it will be easy
to manage multiple layouts and themes, that can
be independently generated.  

If the directory *DUNST_DIR/layouts* doesnt exist,
`dunstmerge` will split the current (or the default)
*dunstrc* file and create a default layout the first
time `dunstmerge` is executed. It will also create
*dunst-theme* and *dunst-settings* and copy any old
dunstrc to *DUNST_DIR/dunstrc-orginal*. It will also
copy the default dunstrc to *DUNST_DIR/dunstrc-default*.

OPTIONS

FILES
-----

*DUNST_DIR*  
Directory containing the dunst configuration files, themes
and layouts.  

*DUNST_DIR/dunstrc*  
This file will get generated by `dunstmerge` and used by
`dunst`.  

*DUNST_DIR/dunstrc-original*  
If a dunstrc file existed prior to the first time `dunstrc`,
was executed, that file will be copied here.  

*DUNST_DIR/dunstrc-default*  
This is just a copy of */usr/share/dunst/dunstrc* for 
reference. It has very good comments.  

*DUNST_DIR/dunst-theme*  
Contains theme specific settings, such as colors and icons.  

*DUNST_DIR/layouts/LAYOUT*  
Layout specific settings, such as geometry and text options.  

*DUNST_DIR/layouts/default*  
default layout file.  

*DUNST_DIR/dunst-settings*  
Other *global* dunst settings that are independent of the
theme or the layout.
